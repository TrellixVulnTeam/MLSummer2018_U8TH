# MLSummer2018

A collection of notes all from a peer/self taught class on Machine Learning. 
Most materials are based off of Sebastian Raschka's wonderful "Python Machine Learning".
Many notebooks are based off of the chapters in this book.

All notebooks here are authored or coauthored by individuals in the following list:
myself, Robert Morgan, Greg Holdman, Trevor Oxholm, Juan Bohorquez, Cody Poole, and Preston Huft.
